The *Option Smile Modelling* app displays and interpolates implied volatilities for stock options via our [piece-wise option pricing model](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5214566).

We use an open source data and technology stack. If you want to learn about the methodologies, data and tools, get in touch via [sebastian.schlenkrich@frame-consult.de](mailto:sebastian.schlenkrich@frame-consult.de) or checkout the documentation page.

The app is for research and educational purpose only. If you want to adapt it to a production environment, please get in touch. We are happy help!
